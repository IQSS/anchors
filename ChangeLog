1.0 : 2002-10-22 : by Jonathan Wand
* Initial release

1.1 : 2002-11-09 : by Jonathan Wand
* chopit():
** change default setting: NOW do.oprobit=FALSE
** uses optim(,hessian=T) for Hessian; drops RAM intensive fdHess

1.4 : 2003-08-30 : by Jonathan Wand
* REQUIRES >= R 1.8
* tcl/tk
** - Windows GUI version of anchors.gui() no longer requires separate
**   installation of tcl/tk.

** - implements namespace/S3
** - created NAMESPACE file to define exported functions
** - added package info for .C calls
* chopit
** - removed used of auto.attach for packv; uses local scoped variables

** - cleans up listwise deletion code; NOTE: no longer delete cases with !is.finite():
**   relies entirely on model.matrix() for case deletion choices
* mrop / mrop.summary
** - new function by Dan Hopkins

** - added man page for mrop.* (just a shell, Dan needs to fills these in)

1.7
* Dan Hopkins and Gary King redefine C when vectored valued
  produced by anchors.np()
* This definition of C existed only for this one release,
  and is not supported in any other.

1.8 - 1.9-2:  UNOFFICIAL and dubious versions of code
* These versions were not intended for public use/distribution
* These versions were experimental and untested versions of code
  that were posted by a rogue programmer on one local but publicly accessable site:
  http://gking.harvard.edu/R/CRAN/src/contrib/
  http://gking.harvard.edu/bin/windows/contrib/2.3
* Any user who inadvertently found and used these versions of the code
  should NOT rely on results produced by these versions.

2.0 : 2007-02-06 : Jonathan Wand
* This is a significant rewrite/reorganization of the library
  Highlights of user noticeable changes are listed below.
* At this point in development it was felt to be more important to
  establish consistency of invocations across functions than to maintain
  backward compatibility.

* S3 methods are used uniformly throughout
* formula / model.matrix invocation use throughout,
** - replacing list of string vectors
** - retains convention that missing self/vignette responses
**   are coded as zero (thus are not deleted in parametric model [chopit]
**   but are deleted in non-parametric models [ anchors ]
* most uses of term 'ties' in anchors()/C is changed to 'intervals'
**   BUT ties is still an unambigious and used term in vignette.order()
* drops need for library(combinat)
** - now in library(utils)

* demo/
** - new demo files for functions
* data/
** - additional datasets available

* anchors()
** - was anchors.np()
** - returned to earlier definition of 'C'
** - improved naming of returned values
* anchors.me()
** - new function to get minimal entropy allocation of interval of C
** - best user interface for use of minimum.entropy()
* cpolr()
** - modification of polr[MASS] allowing for intervals in ordered probit
**   REPLACES 1.9-2 mrop() which had errors
** - fitted.cpolr() method:
**   if combined with anchors object, also can produce conditional fitted values
* anchors.intervals()
** - was anchors.intervals()
** - separates out/new methods plot.anchors.intervals() and print.anchors.intervals()
* chopit.density()
** - was chopit.posterior
* entropy()
** - now calcuates entropy for single vignette subsets too
** - uses minimum.entropy(), which deterministically finds
**   minimum entropy allocation of interval Cs
** - genoud search still an option, but is not needed given
**   minimum.entropy(); will likely be dropped in future versions
** - renamed column headings of output
* func.packv: removed all uses of attach()
* insert() [ by Olivia Lau, with corrections ]
** - new helper function to take C in anchors object and
**   insert into original dataframe used to create C
* minimum.entropy()
** - new function for calculating minimum entropy allocation
**   of interval values of C in a deterministic manner with
**   finite steps
* replace.value()
** - helper function to replace values in specified columns of dataframe
**   used to facilitate '0'=missing value convention for responses
* vignette.order()
** - additional diagnostics of ordering


2.0-1 : 2007-02-19 : Jonathan Wand

* chopit
** - enable vignette only invocation
** - corrected use of model.matrix to get vign with intercepts
**   even when no vars specified
** - drop vign.only option (only previouly useful for sets of vignettes)
** - single vignette handled differently

* anchors
** - enable dataframes with single row

* summary.chopit
** - return invisible coefficient matrix

* demo(anchors.mexch)
** - updated/corrected change to Cunif

2.0-3: 2007-07-01 : Jonathan Wand : minor changes, not publicly released

3.0-1: 2008-04-20 : Jonathan Wand : major changes : not public

NOTE: new simplified syntax NOT backward compatible with prior versions
exceptions are vanilla call,
    anchors(formula.list, data, method="chopit")
  same as
    chopit(formula.list, data)

* anchors(): NEW unified function call
** - replaces chopit, anchors, vignette.order
** - includes simplified use of cpolr
** - additional S3 summary() for each method, and [bar]plot for some methods

* anchors.options: NEW unified handling of options for anchors functions
* anchors.data: NEW unified handling of data building based on anchors formulas
** - allows user specified missing values in responses (see anchors.options)
** - allows NA in responses to not cause listwise deletion
     i.e., allows user controlled listwise or minimal deletion

* trim.data: UPDATE generalizes and replaces subset.anchors
* replace.list: UPDATE minor update
* replace.value: NAME CHANGE was replacevalue (changed for consistency)

3.0-2 : JW : minor changes
* plot functions made fully compliant with generic R invocations
  revised barplot.anchors.rank replaces plot.anchor.rank
  revised barplot.anchors.order replace pot.anchors.order
* anchors method= now icludes B and C, replacing 'mehthod="rank" and type="B"', etc
  and method="entropy" is dropped, replaced by combn=TRUE
* new demo(anchors.plot)
* enhanced documentation for plot functions, and anchors.chopit

3.0-4 : JW :
* returns to separate anchors() and chopit() funcitons; retains simplified interface

3.0-8 : CH :
* Changed as.real() to as.numeric throughout
* Generally made compatible with R >= 3.0.0, put imports to MASS and rgenoud in namespace, removed required() calls to MASS and rgenoud as they are stated dependencies.
* Removed all calls to html.sty in anchors vignette

3.0-9 : NHG :

* Moved `MASS` and `rgenoud` to `Imports`.
* Updated and removed broken links.
* Fixed bugs related to installation
* Cleaned code (e.g., `class() == .` to `inherits()`)
